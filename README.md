# Weather Dashboard

Built a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions and the future weather for multiple cities.

```
As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly
```

* Application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* Display the following under current weather conditions: City name, Date, Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions), Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed and UV index.

* Includes a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name performs a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city. 

* Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast displays the following: Date, Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions), Temperature and Humidity.

* User can search for weather reports by entering city name in search textbox.

* Application depicts the weather conditions by interactively changing the background image on the screen according to the current weather of the city.

* Application displays the weather at the user's current location at the initial landing page using Geolocation API.
